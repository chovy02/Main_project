**Key Features**
- Tight, responsive keyboard controls (arrow keys + action keys).
- Two switchable weapons for different play styles: **Sword** (melee) and **Bow** (ranged).
- A linear level that culminates in a **boss fight**.
- Simple, readable UI for health and current weapon.

## Controls
| Action | Key |
|---|---|
| Move Left | **Left Arrow** |
| Move Right | **Right Arrow** |
| Jump | **Up Arrow** |
| Attack | **X** |
| Switch Weapon | **Z** |

**Control Notes**
- Holding a direction will keep your character moving; tap **Up** to jump over gaps or hazards.
- Attacking while moving may slightly adjust timing and spacing—practice spacing for sword swings vs. bow shots.

---

## Weapons
Two weapons are available at all times upon pickup—swap with **Z** whenever you need.

### ⚔️ Sword (Melee)
- **Strengths:** High burst damage at close range, quick follow‑ups.
- **Best for:** Clearing small monsters quickly, finishing blows on the boss when it’s safe to get close.
- **Mind:** You must be within melee reach; learn enemy patterns to avoid taking hits.

### 🏹 Bow (Ranged)
- **Strengths:** Attack from a safer distance, great for poking enemies and the boss while staying mobile.
- **Best for:** Hazardous areas with tight platforms, chipping away at enemies across gaps.
- **Mind:** Positioning matters—give yourself space to line up shots.

> **Pro Tip:** Swap dynamically. Use bow to approach and control space; switch to sword to capitalize on openings.

---

## Core Gameplay
- **Movement & Platforming:** Navigate platforms, pits, and environmental hazards. Timing jumps is essential.
- **Combat:** Combine movement with attacks. Many encounters reward hit‑and‑run tactics or kiting with the bow.
- **Enemy Variety:** Smaller monsters pressure you between obstacles—learn their approach ranges and wind‑ups.
- **Boss Arena:** The level funnels into a final arena. Observe the boss’s attack patterns, wait for safe windows, then strike.
- **Damage & Health:** Taking hits reduces your **HP**. If it reaches **0**, you lose.

---

## Win / Lose Conditions
- **Win:** Defeat the final **Boss** at the end of the map.
- **Lose:** Your **HP** reaches **0** (you die). Restart and try again.

---

## HUD & UI
While playing, you will see:
- **Health (HP):** Your remaining life. Keep an eye on it before risky jumps or trades.
- **Current Weapon Indicator:** Shows whether you’re using **Sword** or **Bow** after switching with **Z**.

> Depending on the build, UI placement may vary slightly, but HP and current weapon are always visible.

---

## Tips for New Players
- **Learn jump timing:** Practice short vs. long jumps and how your character’s momentum carries over platforms.
- **Use space wisely:** Bow is safer when enemies crowd platforms—thin them out before committing.
- **Don’t be greedy:** One safe sword hit is better than trading multiple hits and losing HP.
- **Watch patterns:** Even small monsters have tells; the boss has repeatable phases—punish the gaps.
- **Reset the room:** If you get flustered, back off, switch to bow, and regain control of the fight.

---

## System Requirements
**Platform:** Web (itch.io embed)

**Recommended:**
- A modern desktop browser (Chromium‑based or Firefox, latest version).
- Keyboard with arrow keys (required for movement).
- Stable internet to load game assets the first time.

**Mobile:** Touch controls are not supported; play on desktop/laptop.

---

## Browser & Fullscreen
- **Keyboard Focus:** Click inside the game frame once to ensure arrow/X/Z keys register.
- **Fullscreen:** Use the itch.io fullscreen button (if shown) or your browser’s fullscreen mode (**F11** / **⌃⌘F**).
- **Performance:** Close heavy tabs, disable unnecessary extensions, and keep the game tab active.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **No input / keys don’t work** → Click inside the game canvas to focus it. On macOS, ensure the browser tab is active and not in picture‑in‑picture.
- **Game feels slow or laggy** → Try another modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox), close other tabs, or toggle fullscreen.
- **Audio is too loud** → Use the system/browser volume mixer. (If the build includes in‑game options, use the pause/options menu.)
- **Stuck after dying** → Reload the page to restart cleanly.

If issues persist, leave a comment on the itch.io page with your **OS**, **browser**, and what happened.

---

## Accessibility Notes
- **Input:** Keyboard‑only (arrow keys + X/Z). A gamepad is not required and may not be supported.
- **Visuals:** Platforming requires timing and spatial awareness; play fullscreen for better visibility if needed.
- **Audio:** You can mute the browser tab if the build does not offer in‑game audio toggles.
